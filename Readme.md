# Design Data Warehouse Practice

## Project Overview

**Design Data Warehouse Practice** is a project focused on designing and implementing different types of data warehouse architectures to support complex data analysis and reporting needs. In this project, I will be designing two primary data warehouse schemas:

1. **Data Warehouse - Star Schema**
2. **Data Warehouse - Snowflake Schema**

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in developing efficient data warehouse structures that facilitate advanced data analytics and business intelligence reporting.

## Sales Data Warehouse - Star Schema

In this part of the project, I will design a Star Schema for a Sales Data Warehouse. This schema is optimized for querying and reporting, making it easier to generate insights such as total sales revenue per city, product category, and store.

### Star Schema Characteristics:
- **Fact Table:** Contains quantitative data for analysis, such as sales amount, quantity sold, and transaction details.
- **Dimension Tables:** Provide descriptive information, such as product details, store locations, and time periods, that relate to the facts in the fact table.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for straightforward and efficient querying, suitable for generating sales performance reports.

## Sales Data Warehouse - Snowflake Schema

In the next phase, I will design a Snowflake Schema, which is a more normalized version of the star schema. This design minimizes redundancy and optimizes storage by breaking down dimension tables into related sub-dimension tables.

### Snowflake Schema Characteristics:
- **Normalized Dimensions:** Dimension tables are split into multiple related tables to eliminate redundancy.
- **Complex Queries:** Supports complex query scenarios but might require more joins than a star schema.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for large-scale data warehouses where storage efficiency and data integrity are critical.

## Project Objectives

1. **Design and Implement Data Warehouse Schemas:** Develop both Star and Snowflake schemas based on different business use cases.
2. **Develop Complex SQL Queries:** Write SQL queries to support various analytical needs, including rollups, grouping sets, and cube queries.
3. **Create Materialized Views:** Optimize query performance by creating materialized views for frequently accessed reports.



## Conclusion

By the end of this project, I will have a comprehensive understanding of different data warehouse design patterns and their applications. This will enhance my skills in building robust data warehouses that support high-performance data analytics and reporting.
